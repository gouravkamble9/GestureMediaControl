# GestureMediaControl
GestureMediaControl is a Python project that allows users to control various media applications, such as PowerPoint, YouTube, and audio players, using hand gestures. This project utilizes the MediaPipe library for hand tracking and gesture recognition, providing a unique and intuitive way to interact with media content.

Key Features:

- Hand Gesture Recognition: The project leverages the power of MediaPipe to detect and track hand gestures in real-time. It provides accurate and responsive hand gesture recognition for controlling PowerPoint presentations.
- PowerPoint Control: Users can perform various actions on PowerPoint slides using hand gestures. This includes controlling the slide navigation (next slide, previous slide), marking on slides with a virtual marker, erasing markings, and more.
- Pointer Control: The project allows users to control a virtual pointer on the PowerPoint slides using their hand movements. They can move the pointer around, click on objects, and interact with the presentation content.
- Video Control: Additionally, GesturePPTControlPlus supports video control within PowerPoint presentations. Users can play, pause, seek, and adjust the volume of embedded videos using hand gestures.
- YouTube and Audio Control: This project goes beyond PowerPoint and also includes control for external media. Users can use hand gestures to play, pause, seek, and adjust the volume of YouTube videos and audio players.

Dependencies:

- Python 
- MediaPipe
- pyautogui
- OpenCV
- tkinter

By using GestureMediaControl, users can enhance their PowerPoint presentation experience by controlling slides, videos, and audio with simple hand gestures. The project provides a unique and engaging way to interact with media content, making presentations more dynamic and interactive.
